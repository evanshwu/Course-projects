# Course assignments, exercises, and mini projects

This repository contains assignments from the programming courses I have taken during my undergraduate degree at National Chung Cheng University.

### 1st academic year: Object-oriented Technology(I) - JAVA
Each of the projects were completed using Eclipse Neon, simply import the projects into Eclipse's workspace and everything should work fine.

* *Addressbook practice* - A simple object-oriented programming exercise
* *Fibonacci exercise*
* *guiHW* - Personal information forms with Java GUI
* *Guipaint* - An exercise to draw a picture using Java GUI
* *SupersubclassHW* - A more complete object-oriented programming exercise (Graphics card ordering system)

### 1st academic year: Program Design
This course is actually C# prgramming, projects were completed with Visual Studio 2010.

* *Console Application* - A console-based math quiz program
* *MidHW01* - A ticket purchasing system 

### 2nd academic year: Assembly Language
This course teaches us ARM assembly language. All assignments were compiled using *arm-elf-gcc*. It was a very special programming language comparing modern *object-oriented* languages when I was learning it. It became useful after I started designing Bluetooth Low Energy programs on *Nordic's nRF52832* chip, which was running an ARM microprocessor.

* *HW1* - A simple exercise for getting started to arm assembly compiler
* *HW2* - Finding GCD
* *HW3* - Matrix computation
* *HW4* - Number sorting

### 2nd academic year: XML and Internet Service
This course teaches everything about XML using Java. It also taught us about Java sockets and multithreading.

* *XML_project1* - Library checkout system

### 2nd academic year: Webpage Design
This course was about HTML and PHP programming. Projects were tested using XAMPP.

* *class_activity1* - HTML table exercise
* *class_activity2* - PHP warmup
* *class_activity3* - PHP login exercise
* *class_activity4*
* *Inclass Exercise*
* *Midterm*
* Final project *(Not uploaded)*

### 2nd academic year: Multimedia Systems
* *Android Calculator*
* *Java Calculator*
* *Kourse* Android application *(Not uploaded)*

### 2nd academic year: Java Programming - Enterprise and Embedded Systems
Assignments are compiled with Eclipse Neon.

* *HW1* - 2D/3D shapes and area calculation
* *HW2* - Salary payment system (console-based)
* *HW3* - Rational and HugeInteger exercise
