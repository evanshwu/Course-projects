In this file, you will see 2 things:
- Instructions.pdf
	This file contains how the whole program was written, and how it actually
	process inputs. 

- projectfile (folder)
	Under this folder contains the original project we tested in our computer,
	you will notice that the .java file is Test.java, and on github we have 
	uploaded two files, because we had to change lots of codes in it to make 
	it runs better, we rename it as Test2.java, but it is same as the java file 
	contained in this zip file.

*********************************************************
- Code change history:
	You may notice there's no history file contained here, that's because 
	our change history are on GitHub, visit there and you will see the whole
	timeline.

- Code Execute
	To make sure everything's cool, some of you are still new to eclipse, if you
	visit our GitHub page, I've placed a link in the README.md to download Eclipse
	Keplar, which is the IDE we used to create our project.

- Code explainations
	Our code is a bit complex if you don't understand what "phase" means, I did
	add a pdf file on here, but if any problem came up, just contact us.

		***TO BE NOTICED***
	Our calculator is still a half-done project, currently some easy operations 
	may look fine, but if you add multiple commands, the program may crash.
