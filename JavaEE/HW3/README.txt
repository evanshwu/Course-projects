Dear TA:

This project was written by Hsin Han Wu(ID 403530026), and compiled on Eclipse Neon.2. To run this program 
in a simple way, use Eclipse and import the whole project and it should be good. 

Files are under /src/*, as two java files Rational.java and HugeInteger.java, both program comtains a 
pre-done main function, however you are required to unmark the main function if you wanted to run it.
